  <h2>I have been working on my skills!</h2>
  <p>I can write in HTML and style in CSS code.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I know how to use Github</li>
    <li>I can use the Command Line in Bash/GitBash</li>
    <li>I can style CSS with HEX, HSL and RGB coloring</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>What I am currently learning.</h2>
  <p>I am finishing up with CSS styling and since I have already put time in with JS, this next section will mainly be a refresher before I move onto learning React and Redux</p>
  <h2>What is my goal?</h2>
  <p>My goal is to be a front-end engineer. Eventually I will become a full-stack developer, but I am a mom and I take my wins with gratitude.</p>
